# Earth_quake_prediction
Developed a methodology to predict the time left for the quake to occur, when an acoustic signal is passed as input from an artificially created lab environment.  
It has got two version  
- First version, we predicted using Machine learning Models to satisfy the course Applied Machine learning.
- Second version, we predicted using Deep learning Models to satisfy the course Deep learning.
- First version complete repository is available in the repository.
- For the deep learning, we took the help of google colab since the code is crashing in our local machines, Attached link to access the code right here, also attached a in-class paper which I have been a part of.
